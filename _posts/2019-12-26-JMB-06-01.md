### Solved

It's so simple trick. Devide a part of plus previous summary, then call recursively.

{% highlight haskell linenos %}
recursive :: Int -> Int
recursive n
  | n <= 0    = 0
  | otherwise = n + recursive (n-1)

main :: IO()
main = do
  -- if, n = 10
  outputInt <- return $ recursive 10 
  putStrLn $ show outputInt
{% endhighlight %}
