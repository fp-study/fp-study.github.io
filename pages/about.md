How wonderful Functional Program Language, `Haskell`!

We want to understand more and more, `What is Functional Thinking?`.

Since 2019-01, we have read haskell book, [Learn You a Haskell for Great Good(Miran Lipovaca/2011)](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/manatee-pdfviewer-0.1.0/src/data/welcome/LearnYouAHaskell.pdf).

Since 2019-11, we have tried to solve [Algoritm Problems](https://book.algospot.com/) using Haskell.

Keep going!
